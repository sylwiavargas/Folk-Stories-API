HERE WILL BE ALL TH EJOINTS

Angela Davis
Women’s House of Detention, which
stood on the site that is now the Jefferson Market Garden. Lacking meaningful
evidence, the government used love letters between Angela and George to try to
sway the jury.
A global movement emerged to demand freedom for Angela Davis and all
political prisoners. The Rolling Stones wrote “Sweet Black Angel.” John Lennon
and Yoko Ono released “Angela” in her support. Angela’s brilliant testimony in
the courtroom convinced the all-white jury of the absurdity of the claims against
her. They acquitted her of all charges.


-----------------------------------------------------Women's House of Detention

The Jefferson Market Library was formerly a courthouse. The garden
was a jail. Striking workers from the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory were
dragged here as a matter of intimidation. In 1929, the jail was
demolished to make way for the New York Women's House of
Detention, which opened in 1932. Redistricting closed the court in
1945. The community rallied together to preserve the building. Thanks
to their efforts, the building opened as a library in 1967.
Prominent activists, including LREI graduate Angela Davis,
Dorothy Day, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Ethel Rosenberg, Claudia Jones,
and Andrea Dworkin were held at the Women's House of Detention.
Several wrote about the appalling conditions inside, which led to its
closure in 1974. The community that organized to turn the courthouse
into a library now mobilized to demolish the prison to make way for a
garden.
